# Render Frontend Deployment Fix

## The Issue:
Render is looking for package.json in `/opt/render/project/src/frontend/package.json` but your frontend is in `frontend/Track/` directory.

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Use Vercel for Frontend (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" 
4. Import your expTracker repository
5. Configure:
   - Framework Preset: Vite
   - Root Directory: `frontend/Track`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `dist`
6. Add Environment Variables:
   - VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://exptracker-backend-91h0.onrender.com
   - VITE_NODE_ENV=production
7. Deploy

### Option 2: Fix Render Configuration
If you want to use Render for frontend:

1. In Render dashboard, when creating the frontend service:
   - Set Root Directory to: `frontend/Track`
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory: `dist`

### Option 3: Create a Root Package.json (Not Recommended)
Create a package.json in the root directory that points to the correct frontend location.

## Recommendation:
Use Vercel for frontend deployment as it's specifically optimized for React/Vite applications and will be much easier to configure.
